Quick setup guide

1) Maven Import the omegapoint projects into Eclipse
2) You'll need a few extra deps for lwjgl and can get them by running "mvn test -P test-java"
3) Add the following VM args to the Java run configuration (note, adjust the path!): "-Djava.library.path=[absolute path to your omegapoint directory]/java/target/natives -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m"
